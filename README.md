# KMeansClustering
The goal of this analysis is to cluster data points based on similarity using un-supervised machine learning algorithm. I used Kmeans clustering in R with stats package. I created three centers to analyze the contents in the different clusters. 

## Data
The script uses the Cereals data-set. The dataset contains information related to different cereals such as calories, sugar, salt and other properties. 

## API
I built a basic model that usese in-built package in R and test the algorithm on the Cereals dataset. 

## Steps to run the script
- Download R-server and R-Studio. 
- Clone the repo 
- Set the path of the cereals file in the read.CSV

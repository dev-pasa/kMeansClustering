# KMeansClustering

https://rpubs.com/devshrestha/Cereals_data_clustering

Analyze the cereal dataset by clustering data points based on similarity using un-supervised machine learning algorithm. Clustering based on Kmeans clustering in R within stats package. First created 5 centers then 3 clusters to analyze the contents in the different clusters. 

## Data
The script uses the Cereals data-set. The dataset contains information related to different cereals such as calories, sugar, salt and other properties. 

## API
Built a basic model that usese in-built package in R and test the algorithm on the Cereals dataset. 

## Steps to run the script
- Download and install R-server and R-Studio. 
- Clone the repo 
- Set the path of the cereals file in the read.CSV
- Run the applicaton on R-Studio

## KMeansClustering
`The script is published in rpubs. Rpubs is a free publising site for r-markdowns and can be implemented from within R-Studio `

https://rpubs.com/devshrestha/Cereals_data_clustering

Using R-Studio to analyze the cereal dataset by clustering data points based on similarity using un-supervised machine learning algorithm. Clustering is based on Kmeans clustering in Stats package. First created 5 centers then 3 clusters to analyze the contents in the different clusters. 
#### The R Stats Package
- This package contains functions for statistical calculations and random number generation.

## Data
The script uses the Cereals data-set. The dataset contains information related to different cereals such as calories, sugar, salt and other properties. 

## API
Built a basic model that usese in-built packages in R and used to test it on the Cereals dataset. 

## Steps to run the script
- Download and install R-server and R-Studio. 
- Clone the repo 
- Set the path of the cereals file in the read.CSV
- Run the applicaton on R-Studio
